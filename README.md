# Genomic_prediction

Jupyter notebook "Genome to Field Genomic Prediction" provided three implementations for genomic prediction in R. 
a. Penalized linear regression based on glmnet package
b. Kernel regression for two type of kernels: 
   1. Linear kernel
   2. Euclidean distance based Gaussian kernel 
 
Jupyter notebook "Kernel matrix" provided the kernel matrix calculation based on DNA marker in Python, 
which is computational more friendly than R
